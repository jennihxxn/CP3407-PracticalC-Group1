Register via an online form.
Book gym sessions from an interactive schedule.
2. Enable Administrators to:
Monitor and manage user registrations.
Track gym usage statistics over time.

3. Integrate additional features like:
A virtual gym tour using embedded 3D models or video.
An AI-powered gym trainer for personalized workout plans based on user goals and activity logs.
