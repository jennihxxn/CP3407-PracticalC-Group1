# Iteration 1 Retrospective

**Iteration Period:** 27 June 2025 â€“ 6 July 2025  
**Team Members:** Kim Jihyun, Kim Jihun, Yermukhamet Akbet, Wei Shipeng

---

## What Went Well

- Clear task division between frontend and backend developers led to focused development.
- Backend work (APIs, authentication, booking logic) was completed ahead of iteration, enabling smooth frontend integration.
- Figma design and component structure were finalized and followed closely, ensuring consistent UI implementation.
- All four planned user stories were completed within the iteration scope.
- Collaboration between frontend members was effective, especially on shared tasks like booking feedback confirmation.

---

## What Could Be Improved

- Frontend development started late due to the study week, compressing available work time.
- Integration testing was limited due to tight scheduling; more buffer time is needed in future iterations.
- The actual velocity was 0.47 (9 days completed out of 19 person-days), indicating lower-than-expected output.
- Not all developers updated GitHub consistently, which made tracking progress less transparent.

---

## Action Items for Next Iteration

- Begin frontend and integration work earlier, even if backend is already complete.
- Allocate time specifically for bug fixing, review, and polish.
- Break down larger tasks into smaller, trackable subtasks to improve estimation and progress tracking.
- Set a regular update rhythm (e.g., daily check-ins) to improve communication and accountability.

## Summary

Despite time constraints due to the study week, the team successfully completed all planned work for Iteration 1. With earlier frontend kickoff and improved task tracking, future iterations can aim for higher velocity and better testing coverage.
