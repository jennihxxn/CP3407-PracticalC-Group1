# Iteration 1 Retrospective

**Iteration Period:** 27 June 2025 â€“ 6 July 2025  
**Team Members:** Kim Jihyun, Kim Jihun, Yermukhamet Akbet, Wei Shipeng

## What Went Well

- Clear task division between frontend and backend developers led to focused development.
- Backend work (APIs, authentication, booking logic) was completed ahead of iteration, enabling smooth frontend integration.
- Figma design and component structure were finalized and followed closely, ensuring consistent UI implementation.
- All four planned user stories were completed within the iteration scope.
- Collaboration between frontend members was effective, especially on shared tasks like booking feedback confirmation.

## What Could Be Improved

- Frontend development started late due to the study week, compressing available work time.
- A major GitHub mistake in Week 2 caused the deletion of all files in the main branch. The team had to reconstruct the project from scratch, which added unexpected pressure and delays.
- The homepage feature, initially scheduled for Iteration 1, was postponed to Iteration 2 due to limited progress from the assigned team member during the iteration.
- Integration testing was limited due to tight scheduling; more buffer time is needed in future iterations.
- The actual velocity was 0.47 (9 days completed out of 19 person-days), indicating lower-than-expected output.
- Not all developers updated GitHub consistently, which made tracking progress less transparent.

## Action Items for Next Iteration

- Begin frontend and integration work earlier, even if backend is already complete.
- Allocate time specifically for bug fixing, review, and polish.
- Break down larger tasks into smaller, trackable subtasks to improve estimation and progress tracking.
- Set a regular update rhythm (e.g., daily check-ins) to improve communication and accountability.
- Improve version control discipline to avoid accidental deletions and ensure recovery checkpoints.

## Summary

Despite time constraints due to the study week and a major GitHub issue, the team successfully completed all planned user stories for Iteration 1. With improved task ownership, early starts, and better tracking practices, the team is in a strong position to increase delivery quality and velocity in the next iteration.
